# outbound-dialing-backend

This project is a demo backend service that compliments the front end outbound dialpad solution [here](https://github.com/jhunter-twilio/plugin-flex-outbound-dialpad)

It exposes a websocket that can be used to:
  - trigger a call from a client
  - push updates of the call status back to that client
  - hang up a call for a given client
  
 It also exposes two end points that are called by twilio when:
   - providing updates to the status of calls generated by this server
   - twilio retrieves a twiml document to describe how to handle a call when it is answered

# Dependencies

Before setting up this server you must first created a dedicated TaskRouter workflow for outbound calls.  You can do this [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard). Make sure it is part of your **Flex Task Assignment** workspace.

- ensure there is the following matching workers expression for the only filter on the workspace
  - task.targetWorker==worker.contact_uri
- ensure the priorty of the filter is set to 1000 (or at least the highest in the system)
- make sure the filter matches to a queue with Everyone on it. The default Everyone queue will work but if you want to seperate real time reporting for outbound calls, you should make a dedicated queue for it with a queue expression
  - 1==1

# Setup

You can now setup the server, you can either deploy to heroku (which is free, you just need a login) or you can setup locally and expose via ngrok

# Deploying to heroku

1. Use this link to begin [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jhunter-twilio/outbound-dialing-backend/tree/master)

2. Populate the given variables when prompted
    - TWILIO_OUTBOUND_WORKFLOW_SID - the SID of the workflow you just created - used for creating tasks
    - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID - the account sid of your twilio account - used for calling Twilio APIs
    - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN - the auth token of your twilio account - used for calling Twilio APIs
    - EXTERNAL_HOST - the host that exposes this service - used for telling Twilio where to make callbacks when calling the Twilio APIs.  Should be of the form https://<HEROKU_APP_NAME>.herokuapp.com
    
3. You're all set, the backend is ready.  You can access it on https://<HEROKU_APP_NAME>.herokuapp.com and you can create a websocket on wss://<HEROKU_APP_NAME>.herokuapp.com/websocket 
  - https://www.websocket.org/echo.html is an excellent web page for testing the websocket is exposed correctly.
  
# Deploying locally

1. Clone repository using git clone 
2. run ```npm install```
3. run ```ngrok http 3000```
3. start server using ```TWILIO_OUTBOUND_WORKFLOW_SID=<WORKFLOWSID> TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<ACCOUNTSID> TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<AUTHTOKEN> EXTERNAL_HOST=https://<NGROK-ENDPOINT> DEBUG=outbound-dialing-backend:* npm start```

# change log
v1.1 - updated websocket endpoint to reflect its dedicated to outbound calling

v1.0 - initial release

# TODOs

1. consolidate backend server with other plugin solutions that require event push to client from backend.  (e.g. real time dashboard)
